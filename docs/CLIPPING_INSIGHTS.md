# SUMMARY
The video "Absurdly LOUD Mixes and How The Pros Actually Do It" by Alex Emrich explains that while traditional audio mixing teaches to avoid clipping, professionals strategically use it to achieve louder and punchier mixes (0:00-0:57).

## Clipping vs. Limiting:

Limiters squish down transients (the initial peaks of a sound, like drums) against a threshold (1:23-2:04). This compresses the dynamic range, making the mix less punchy as it gets louder (2:48-3:00, 5:13-5:23).
Clippers chop off transients clean, rather than squishing them (3:07-4:08, 5:26-5:32). This allows the signal to retain its punchiness because the clipping can be done transparently (5:32-5:41).
Transparent Clipping and Headroom:

The primary use of a clipper discussed in the video is to transparently clip transients to gain more headroom (7:29-8:09). Headroom is the distance between the loudest parts of your signal and digital zero (8:09-8:21).
By clipping downwards, you can make the clipping point happen earlier, effectively reducing the peak levels of your signal without audibly affecting the sound (8:48-9:05, 9:58-10:01). This allows for a louder mix later in the mastering stage (10:08-11:08).
The key is to use your ears and clip only until you start to hear distortion; backing off before it becomes audible is essential for transparency (11:25-12:50).
Hard Clipping vs. Soft Clipping (Saturation):

Hard clipping is the transparent method of just cutting off peaks (13:51-13:52, 14:45-14:59).
Soft clipping introduces saturation, which adds an analog-like crunch or warmth to the sound, increasing perceived volume (13:34-14:24). This is used for effect rather than just headroom.
Practical Application and Settings:

A common application for clipping is on drums to control their transients (5:44-6:15). The video demonstrates how clipping the drums transparently allows for more headroom without changing the audible sound (6:19-7:26).
For clipper settings, the speaker recommends an oversampling value of around 16 for better resolution and performance without excessive CPU usage (16:19-16:55).
